# **Basic layout**

### When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

- The interactive R console (entire left)
- Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
- Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

</center>

### Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open in the top left.

# Workflow within RStudio

There are two main ways one can work within RStudio.

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into a .R file to run later. (This is a real labor.... and I do NOT recommend it!)
2. Start writing in an .R file and use RStudio’s shortcut keys for the Run command to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the interactive R console. (This is a great way to use R/RStudio cause all of your code is saved & you'll be able to run the file later on!)

# Let's get to know the R interactive console

(We will be typing everything below directly into the R console, but I have included them as code chunks for KEY purposes!)

### Use R as a calculator

Remember, order of operations matters--the order is the same as you would have learned back in school:

From highest to lowest precedence:

- Parentheses: `(`, `)`
- Exponents: `^` or `**`
- Divide: `/`
- Multiply: `*`
- Add: `+`
- Subtract: `-`

```{r}
1 + 100

3 + 5 * 2

(3 + 5) * 2 # text after each code line is called a "comment"; R ignores anything that follows the # mark

2/10000 # shorthand for “multiplied by 10^XX”. So 2e-4 is shorthand for 2 * 10^(-4).

# 1 +
```

Any time you hit return and the R session shows a “+” instead of a “>”, it means it’s waiting for you to complete the command. If you want to cancel a command you can simply hit “`Esc`” or "`Ctrl`"+"`C`" and RStudio will give you back the “>” prompt.

### Use R to compare things
```{r}
1 == 1  # equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")

1 != 2  # inequality (read as "is not equal to")

1 < 2  # less than

1 <= 1  # less than or equal to
```

### Use R to assign variables
```{r}
x <- 1/40
x

x <- 1/40 # variables can easily be re-assigned/over-written
y <- x * 2
```

Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. They CANNOT start with a number OR contain spaces (**at all**). A few different conventions for longer variable names:

- periods.between.words
- underscores_between_words
- camelCaseToSeparateWords

Your choice of convention is up to , *JUST BE CONSISTENT*.

# Installing packages

Collections of R code that make our lives easier--for example, code developed to wrangle data--are known as *R packages*. These packages are not automatically downloaded when we download R, and must be installed. Either through the GUI interface (Tools --> Install Packages), or in-line in the console using `install.packages()`.

```{r}
# install.packages("dplyr")
```

Once we've downloaded a package, we can use it! R doesn't keep all packages in its working memory, however--it would slow R down to a snail's pace. Instead, we need to "load" the package(s) we are itnerested in using into our R session. We have to load these package(s) into our R session *each time we open R (or RStudio)*.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```
